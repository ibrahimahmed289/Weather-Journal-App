# Weather Journal App

1. This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
2. This project is constructed with HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript.
3. The design is responsive on all screens.
4. I Created API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com.
5. I Added an event listener to an existing HTML button from DOM using Vanilla JS.
6. Then I passed to a fetch call a URL to website api
7. Data is successfully returned from the external API.
8. The client side function takes two arguments, the URL to make a POST to, and an object holding the data to POST.
9. A GET route setup is on the server side with the first argument as a string naming the route, and the second argument a callback function to return the JS object created at the top of server code with data stored in it.
10. Retrieved data is set to HTML elements from the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript.
